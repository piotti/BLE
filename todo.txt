things to do:

+ record temp data, add first and last data points - done
+ figure out setpoint discrepancy - Error in PSoC bit shifting - fixed
+ "deg" to degree sign - done
+ setpoint is 0 when thermo-controller off - done
+ incorporate PID tunings - Set PID tunings through GUI "Command Prompt" window
- see PID output - ouput is read through BLE but not shown in GUI a.t.m.
+ disable dongle port and psoc select when connected - done
+ PID stops when GATT disconnect - added call to stop for GATT disconnect event
+ auto disconnect when window closes - added window closed event which triggers disconnnet
+ PSoC restart advertisement always - set restart advertisement flag to "True" for timeouts

- ITerm cleared with new setpoint
+Thermocouple noise at high temps? (Reading -271.08 deg C) 4.7 uF capacitor to filter out 60Hz AC noise

+ PSoC PCB 4 SSR leaking current? - Wrong SSR, 1727J only for DC. Replaced with 1927J
